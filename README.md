# EDA Lemonade Sales

## Objective

This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a simple lemonade sales dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The goal is to understand how weather conditions and temperature impact daily sales.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is manually created for demonstration purposes and includes:
- **Day** of the week (Monday‚ÄìSunday)
- **Temperature** (¬∞C)
- **Sunny** (Yes/No)
- **Sales** (number of cups sold)

---

## Tools & Libraries

- **Google Colab** for notebook execution
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Imported** required Python libraries.
2. **Created** a simple dataset to simulate real sales data.
3. **Inspected** the dataset: structure, data types, missing values.
4. **Generated** descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation.
5. **Visualized** the data:
    **Histogram**: distribution of sales.
    **Scatter plot**: sales vs. temperature, color-coded by weather.
    **Bar chart**: average sales on sunny vs. non-sunny days.
6. **Calculated** the correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship between temperature and sales.
7. **Summarized** the key findings for business insights.

---

## Key Insights

- **Sales increase with temperature:** Higher temperatures show a clear increase in lemonade sales.
- **Sunny days drive higher sales:** Average daily sales are significantly higher on sunny days.
- **Strong positive correlation:** A correlation coefficient close to **1.0** indicates a strong linear relationship between temperature and sales.

## How to Run

1. Open the `week3_eda_lemonade.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run all code cells in order.
3. Review the outputs, plots, and final summary.
